        <h1>A love letter to lovely</h1>
        <h4><i>Time for a long ass essay.</i></h4>
        <p>
            I love lovely, but like not <i>love.</i> I <b>fucking love lovely so much.</b> You cannot put into words how much, it's simply impossible, my love for lovely simply surpassess what is explainable. <br /> So, I must prove my love for lovely by hugging her like 50 thousand times.
            <br />
            <br />
            Something I can put into words is how much I truly appreciate lovely. She's always there for me and of course I return the favor, but- lovely is just so much more special to me than anything else. She's so sweet and lovable I can't believe I haven't like kissed the shit out of her <b>haha :></b>
            <br />
            Don't even get me started about how fucking cute she is. So goddamn adorable... ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
            <br />
            <br />
            Lovely will forever have a special place in my heart ðŸ’˜
