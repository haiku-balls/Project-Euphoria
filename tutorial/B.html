            Good job handling the first tutorial :)
            <br />
            Now, what exactly will the puzzles be? Well, most of them will have the entire puzzle or part of the puzzle within the console.
            <br />
            Sometimes the title bar...sometimes the source. The source is a tab in your dev tools. Try opening the elements tab.
            <br />
            It should look like this:
            <br />
            <img src="B1.png" alt="image of elements tab"></img>
            <br />
            <br />
            See that comment? <br />
            You'll see these sometimes, make sure to check the elements tab. <br />
            <br />
            What exactly do the console puzzles look like? Well, these will look different, such as different riddles and even different types of puzzles all together.
            <br />
            Want an example? Check the console.
