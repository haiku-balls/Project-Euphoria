# About this program
This program is based off the original Project, named 'Project Cutie', a simple website with puzzles for the users to solve.  
[original build here](https://haiku-balls.github.io/Project-Cutie/) & [original repo](https://github.com/bakabakabakabakabaka/Project-Cutie)  
This version of the program uses Electron (subject to change) to enhance the possible puzzles, and to create a much more streamlined client.  
*Please note: This program is not finished, and uses experimental builds of Electron.*
